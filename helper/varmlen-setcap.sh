# - varmlen-probe gets cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_dac_override:
#     cap_net_admin   - SO_MARK, nft killswitch, ip routes/rules, net sysctls
#     cap_net_raw     - SO_BINDTODEVICE for the tunnel-bypass probes
#     cap_dac_override- write the root-owned rp_filter sysctl + /run state
# - if a third arg is given, it's the old root-helper uninstaller: run it so the
#   migration (remove daemon) + grant-caps happen under a single pkexec prompt.
#
# File caps are cleared whenever a binary is replaced (core update), so this is
# re-run after every download/activate of the active xray.
